					<h1> ABOUT ME </h1>
					<hr class="fading_line">
						<p> 
							It is not uncommon for one to experience an emotional crisis at
							a relatively young age, especially when it does not feel like 
							oneself can get past the magnitude of it all. I, myself, have 
							fought past that and persevered, not only as computer science 
							engineer, but as an individual. 
						</p>
						<p>
							One of my passions is to be able to help those who’ve gone through
							a similar experience, where resources in the community were limited 
							and the help was hardly found. I know that no single approach to 
							every person in this community will always result in the best outcome,
							which is why I’ve been trained to empathize with others and help them 
							the way that they want to be helped. Ultimately, my greatest goal is 
							to continuously be able to develop software applications that can be 
							the most beneficial; whether that would be building on an existing project 
							or completely starting from scratch, as long as it is changing someone’s 
							life around the world.
						</p>
						<p>
							My educational background includes graduating from the prestigious 
							University of California, San Diego in 2016 with a bachelor’s degree 
							in Computer Science and Engineering. Ever since, I’ve been working and 
							building on both my strengths and weaknesses. I’ve been told by my 
							colleagues and co-workers that I’m a tenacious individual who has an 
							eagerness to learn at such a fast pace.
						</p>
						<p>
							Outside of the daily routine, I am currently working on a few side projects 
							(including this portfolio), which will be coming soon, but feel free to ask 
							me about them anyway. You can also catch me playing tutoring others in 
							CS, playing basketball outdoors, or even ruining my relationship with my 
							companions through a game of Catan.
