		My favorite color is green. I used to compete in spicy food challenges.
		I sprained my ankle at least five times playing basketball. I recently
		started hiking, doing Yoga, and running 5k marathons.

	<p class="paragraph">
		One of my passions is to be able to help those who?ve gone through
		a similar experience, where resources in the community were limited 
		and the help was hardly found. I know that no single approach to 
		every person in this community will always result in the best outcome,
		which is why I?ve been trained to empathize with others and help them 
		the way that they want to be helped. Ultimately, my greatest goal is 
		to continuously be able to develop software applications that can be 
		the most beneficial; whether that would be building on an existing project 
		or completely starting from scratch, as long as it is changing someone?s 
		life around the world.
		
		My educational background includes graduating from the prestigious 
		University of California, San Diego in 2016 with a bachelor?s degree 
		in Computer Science and Engineering. Ever since, I?ve been working and 
		building on both my strengths and weaknesses. I?ve been told by my 
		colleagues and co-workers that I?m a tenacious individual who has an 
		eagerness to learn at such a fast pace.

	<p class="topic">AS A PERSON</p>	
	<p class="paragraph">
		It is not uncommon for one to experience an emotional crisis at
		a relatively young age, especially when it does not feel like 
		oneself can get past the magnitude of it all. I, myself, have 
		fought past that and persevered, not only as computer science 
		engineer, but as an individual. 
				
		Outside of the daily routine, I am currently working on a few side projects 
		(including this portfolio), which will be coming soon, but feel free to ask 
		me about them anyway. You can also catch me playing tutoring others in 
		CS, playing basketball outdoors, or even ruining my relationship with my 
		companions through a game of Catan.
